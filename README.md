MAFRA: Managed File Replication Assistant

This is a new project I do start to build a Managed File Replication Assistant that can help myself and other TSEs, with the "cloning is slow"
"cloning is not working" type of issues.

Also is a learning project to learn more about the front-end.

I will start by creating the GUI in HTML + CLARITY and once integrated with a Python Backend + FLASK, I will try to move it to Angular 2.
